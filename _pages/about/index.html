I’m an incoming CS PhD student at Cornell.</p> <p>My research interests are in probablistic machine learning, which include:</p> <ul> <li>generative models</li> <li>large language models</li> <li>AI4Science</li> <li>Sampling &amp; statistical inference</li> </ul> <p>Previously I interned at <strong>Uber</strong> machine learning and spent two wonderful years at the <strong>Flatiron Institute</strong> with Dr. Bob Carpenter. I also graduated from <strong>Columbia University</strong> with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics.</p> <p>I’m interested in many topics outside of research: philosophy, fitness/health, comedy, open source software, etc. I love when people reach out – so please do!</p> </body></html>
