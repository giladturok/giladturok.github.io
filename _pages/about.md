Hey :wave:! I'm an incoming CS PhD student at **Cornell** :bear: currently interning at **Uber** ML.

My research interests are broadly in **probablistic machine learning** :robot: :

- deep generative models
- large language models
- AI4Science
- sampling & statistical inference

Previously, I spent two wonderful years at the **Flatiron Institute** with [Dr. Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io). Before that, I graduated from **Columbia** :lion: with a BA in Applied Mathematics.
