Hey ðŸ‘‹! I'm an incoming CS PhD student at Cornell.

My research interests are in probablistic machine learning, which include:

- generative models
- large language models
- AI4Science
- Sampling & statistical inference

Previously I spent two wonderful years at the **Flatiron Institute** working with Dr. Bob Carpenter. I also interned at Uber machine learning and graduated from Columbia University with a **B.A. in Applied Mathematics**.

I'm interested in many topics outside of research: philosophy, fitness/health, comedy, open source software, etc. I love when people reach out -- so please do!
