Hey :wave:! I'm an incoming CS PhD student at **Cornell University** :bear: currently interning at **Uber** :car:.

My research interests are broadly in **probablistic machine learning* :robot: :

- deep generative models
- large language models
- AI4Science
- sampling & statistical inference

Before my PhD, I spent two wonderful years at the **Flatiron Institute** :office: with [Dr. Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io). Before that, I graduated from **Columbia University** :lion: with a BA in Applied Mathematics.
