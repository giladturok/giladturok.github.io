Hey :wave:! I'm an incoming CS PhD student at Cornell. My research interests are in probablistic machine learning :robot:, which include:

- generative models
- large language models
- AI4Science
- sampling & statistical inference

Previously, I interned at **Uber** machine learning. I also spent two wonderful years at the **Flatiron Institute** with Dr. Bob Carpenter. I graduated from **Columbia University** with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics.

I'm interested in many topics outside of research: philosophy, fitness/health, comedy, open source software, etc. I love when people reach out -- so please do!
